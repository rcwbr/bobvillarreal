The book was translated and published in England by the editor and map publisher John Ogilby under the title, America, Being an Accurate Description of the New World (1671). Ref: In the late 1630s, Holland attempted to reassert its claim over Brazil by establishing a series of forts along the coastline. One of the best-documented colonies was the expedition led by Prince Maurits of Nassau, who attempted to assemble an intellectual court in the New World. He brought with him a group of highly accomplished artists, mapmakers, and scientists to record the mysteries of Brazil. They included the celebrated painter Frans Post, and the astronomer George Markgraf, who produced the first serious study of the southern sky. Artists and Engravers: Some references mention Bernard Picart as the engraver. We have not been able to verify this. Bernard Picart (1673-1733) was a French painter and engraver. Author: Arnoldus Montanus (c.1625–1683) was a Dutch teacher and author. He published books on theology, history, and geography.  Original 1671 engraving.  <span class=\\\"attribution\\\">R.

Ref: In the late 1630s, Holland attempted to reassert its claim over Brazil by establishing a series of forts along the coastline. One of the best-documented colonies was the expedition led by Prince Maurits of Nassau, who attempted to assemble an intellectual court in the New World. He brought with him a group of highly accomplished artists, mapmakers, and scientists to record the mysteries of Brazil.

A three mile perimeter wall encircled several Inca buildings.  On the other side of this wall, an enclosure with eight rectangular buildings around a bright courtyard served as a welcoming place for travelers, with lodging for the people and stables for llamas.  Anco continued that different areas served different functions &ndash; one to house troops, others for conducting religious festivities, still more were food and supply warehouses.  The irrigated terraces on nearby hillsides testified to the agricultural richness of this place.  A nearby warm spring fed water to a pool for cleansing the body.
