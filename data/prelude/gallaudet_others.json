The book was translated and published in England by the editor and map publisher John Ogilby under the title, America, Being an Accurate Description of the New World (1671). Ref: In the late 1630s, Holland attempted to reassert its claim over Brazil by establishing a series of forts along the coastline. One of the best-documented colonies was the expedition led by Prince Maurits of Nassau, who attempted to assemble an intellectual court in the New World. He brought with him a group of highly accomplished artists, mapmakers, and scientists to record the mysteries of Brazil. They included the celebrated painter Frans Post, and the astronomer George Markgraf, who produced the first serious study of the southern sky. Artists and Engravers: Some references mention Bernard Picart as the engraver. We have not been able to verify this. Bernard Picart (1673-1733) was a French painter and engraver.

A corner of the granite Intihuatana, or \\\"hitching post of the sun\\\", was smashed when a camera platform collapsed on top of it. The irregular carved pillar, one of several erected by the Incas at major sites, holds special significance as it was the only Intihuatana not to have been discovered and destroyed by the Spanish conquistadores. The structure is thought to have been an astronomical device, possibly used to predict the solstices of the sun, and is reputed to imbue with energy those who approach it. More than a dozen fragments of rock will be painstakingly reattached, but the changeable and intemperate climate means they could eventually fall off again. \\\"The damage can probably be repaired but [the Intihuatana] will never be quite the same again,\\\" said archaeologist Luis Barreda Murillo.
