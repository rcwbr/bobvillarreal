  caption: "Sept 11, 2000. A camera crew filming a beer commercial has damaged the most important shrine at the Peruvian Inca citadel of Machu Picchu. A corner of the granite Intihuatana, or \\\"hitching post of the sun\\\", was smashed when a camera platform collapsed on top of it. The irregular carved pillar, one of several erected by the Incas at major sites, holds special significance as it was the only Intihuatana not to have been discovered and destroyed by the Spanish conquistadores. The structure is thought to have been an astronomical device, possibly used to predict the solstices of the sun, and is reputed to imbue with energy those who approach it. More than a dozen fragments of rock will be painstakingly reattached, but the changeable and intemperate climate means they could eventually fall off again. \\\"The damage can probably be repaired but [the Intihuatana] will never be quite the same again,\\\" said archaeologist Luis Barreda Murillo.
