  caption: "The Ciudad Mitad del Mundo (Middle of the World City) is a tract of land owned by the prefecture of the province of Pichincha, Ecuador. It is located 16 miles north of the center of Quito. The grounds contain the Monument to the Equator, which highlights the exact location of the Equator from which the country takes its name; they also contain the Ethnographic Museum Middle of the Earth, a museum about the indigenous people ethnography of Ecuador. The 98 ft monument was constructed between 1979 and 1982 by Pichincha's Province Council to replace an older, smaller monument built by the Government of Ecuador in 1936. It is made of iron and concrete and covered with cut and polished andesite stone. The monument was built to commemorate the first Geodesic Mission of the French Academy of Sciences. It conducted experiments to test the flattening at the poles of the characteristic shape of the Earth, by comparing the distance between a degree meridian in the equatorial zone to another level measured in Sweden. The older monument was moved 4.3 miles to the town of CalaCali. Courtesy of Yee Wang."

  caption: "The day after visiting Otavalo, we made our way to the Panecillo. El Panecillo (from Spanish <i>panecillo</i> small piece of bread) is a 650 foot high hill of volcanic-origin located between southern and central Quito. Its peak is at an elevation of 9,895 feet above sea level. The original name used by the aboriginal inhabitants of Quito was Yavirac. There was a temple on top of Yavirac where the Indians worshiped the sun until it was destroyed by the <i>conquistadors</i>. In 1976, the Spanish artist Agust&iacute;n de la Herr&aacute;n Matorras was commissioned to build a 150 foot tall stone monument of a Madonna on the top of Panecillo. Called \\\"Virgin of Panecillo\\\", it is made of seven thousand pieces of aluminum. The Virgin stands on top of a globe and is stepping on a snake, which is classic Madonna iconography. Less traditional are the wings. Locals claim that she is the only one in the world with wings like an angel. Courtesy of GOQUITO."

The imposing edifice has the distinction of being the largest architectural ensemble among the historical structures of colonial Latin America and for this reason is sometimes known as \\\"El Escorial of the New World\\\". The style evolved over almost 143 years of construction (1537-1680) through earthquakes and changes in architectural styles. The Church houses the city's beloved Virgin of Quito (1734).
