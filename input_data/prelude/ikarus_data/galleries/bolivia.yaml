  caption: "Cusco, Peru.  From: 'De Nieuwe en Onbekende Weereld: of beschryving van America en 't Zuid-Land.', by Arnoldus Montanus, published in Amsterdam by Jacob van Meurs in 1671. (The New and Unknown World: or Description of America and the Southland, Containing the Origin of the Americans and South-landers, remarkable voyages thither, Quality of the Shores, Islands, Cities, Fortresses, Towns, Temples, Mountains, Sources, Rivers, Houses, the nature of Beasts, Trees, Plants and foreign Crops, Religion and Manners, Miraculous Occurrences, Old and New Wars: Adorned with Illustrations drawn from the life in America, and described by Arnoldus Montanus). The book was translated and published in England by the editor and map publisher John Ogilby under the title, America, Being an Accurate Description of the New World (1671). Ref: In the late 1630s, Holland attempted to reassert its claim over Brazil by establishing a series of forts along the coastline. One of the best-documented colonies was the expedition led by Prince Maurits of Nassau, who attempted to assemble an intellectual court in the New World. He brought with him a group of highly accomplished artists, mapmakers, and scientists to record the mysteries of Brazil. They included the celebrated painter Frans Post, and the astronomer George Markgraf, who produced the first serious study of the southern sky. Artists and Engravers: Some references mention Bernard Picart as the engraver. We have not been able to verify this. Bernard Picart (1673-1733) was a French painter and engraver. Author: Arnoldus Montanus (c.1625–1683) was a Dutch teacher and author. He published books on theology, history, and geography.  Original 1671 engraving.  <span class=\\\"attribution\\\">R.
